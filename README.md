# Hotel Reservation System

At the beginning of the program you can log in as an user or administrator.

The user will be able to rent a hotel room, entering data such as: name, phone number, email, room type, date of accommodation, number of days.

The administrator will have access to the program database, which contains hotel rooms and user data.
